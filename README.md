# My configuration for i3

This repository contains all my configuration for the **i3** window manager,
which I use on Arch Linux.
Actually, I am currently running the `i3-gaps` fork, available on GitHub and on
the AUR for Arch Linux users (as `i3-gaps-git` ).

## Requirements

- `i3-gaps`: a fork of `i3`
- `polybar`: a bar alternative to the default `i3bar`
- `i3lock` and `i3lock-fancy`: screen locker
- `rofi`: launcher (and more)
- `Font Awesome 5`: for icons in the bar
- `compton`: (optional) for transparency and other effects
- `stalonetray`: standalone system tray
- `jq`: required for renaming workspaces at run-time through `i3-renamews` script

A few other external programs are referenced in my config (e.g.,
`xfce4-screenshooter` for taking screenshots), but you can
obviously use anything else.

## Try it!

On most distributions, you just need to put these files into `~/.config/i3/`.

Some features may not work out-of-the-box because in the configuration you might find
some commands or paths that are customized for my own machine.
