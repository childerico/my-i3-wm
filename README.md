# My configuration for i3

This repository contains all my configuration for i3 WM (on Arch Linux).

## Requirements

- `i3blocks`: to customize contents displayed by i3bar (replacement for `i3status`)
- `i3lock`: screen locker

## Try it!

On most distributions, you just need to put these files into `~/.config/i3/`.
